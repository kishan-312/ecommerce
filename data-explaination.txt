🔄 Actual Execution Flow:

Edit
const reader = new FileReader();           // ✅ Step 1: Create FileReader object

reader.onloadend = () => {                 // ✅ Step 2: Define what happens after reading completes
  const base64Image = reader.result;

  // ✅ Step 5: This runs only AFTER file is fully read
  setLists((prev) => [
    ...prev,
    { fname, email, mobile, pass, gender, file: base64Image },
  ]);
};

if (file) {
  reader.readAsDataURL(file);              // ✅ Step 3: Start reading file (asynchronously)
                                           // FileReader now reads file in background
}
📊 Timeline Order (Real Execution):
Step	What Happens	When?
1	FileReader object is created	Immediately
2	.onloadend event is registered (setup)	Immediately
3	reader.readAsDataURL(file) is called	Immediately
4	File is being read in the background	Async (takes time)
5	Once file reading is done, onloadend triggers	When reading completes

⚠️ Important Note:
You don’t get the base64 string immediately after calling readAsDataURL. That’s why you handle it inside reader.onloadend.

🎯 Simple Analogy:
Think of readAsDataURL(file) like asking someone to scan a document.

You give them the file (step 3).

While they're scanning, you can't access the result.

Once they finish (step 5), they give you the base64 result.
